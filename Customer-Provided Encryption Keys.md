# Protect Data Using AWS KMS - Customer-Provided Encryption Keys (SSE-C)
Server-side encryption(SSE) is about protecting data at rest. AWS allows to protect data at rest within Amazon data centers by using AWS KMS. Using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) allows you to set your own encryption keys.

# How to Bring Your Own Keys into AWS KMS
For production use cases, the key will be generated by HSM or you will be using a key with more 2048 bits. For this demo, We will use 256-Bit AES Symmetric key. If you dont have one, follow the below instructions to generate one.

Generate the Secret Key
We wil be using openssl to generate a 256-bit symmetric key. You can also use dd command. Now we have a binary key stored in the file plain_text_aes_key.bin

openssl rand -out plain_text_aes_key.bin 32
or
dd if=/dev/random of=plain_text_aes_key.bin count=1 bs=32

# AWS KMS GUI
Now that we have our Secret Key, We need to create an entity in KMS to receive our key material.

    Create key in the KMS Console
    Enter an Alias and a Description
    Select External
    Check - The "I understandâ€¦" checkbox
    Choose the set of IAM users that have permission to Use the KMS APIs and,
    Choose the set of IAM users who can Administer the key
    Verify the key policy
    Download the wrapping key, Choose RSAES_OAEP_SHA_1
        The wrapping key is the 2048-bit RSA public key from your AWS account, that will be used to encrypt the 256-bit secret 
        key and import to into KMS.
        This additional step ensure, anyone snooping on my network will not be able to get hold of my secret key.

# Wrap the Secret Key with wrappingKey
UnZIP and put the wrapping key into the same directory that contains your Secret Key.

openssl rsautl -encrypt \
               -in plain_text_aes_key.bin \
               -oaep \
               -inkey wrappingKey_521a8b4c-8463-4ccd-a762-7bcf6a9b2cfc_1227021858 \
               -pubin \
               -keyform DER \
               -out enc.aes.key
               
               
# Import Key material into KMS

# Encrypt with Custom SSE-C in S3
Now you are ready to use your custom Key. Upload an Object to any bucket in the region you created the key and under encryption you should be able to use the new key.
